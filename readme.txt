# This readme is only here so the directory needed for tests doesn't get deleted

On this assignment, I felt that it was fiary easy to write the methods in ArrayMethods.java and using these methods, it was easy to execute 
ClimateQueries. 

Overall, I felt that it was difficult to pace this assignment out because of when we were given the checklist file and I felt like everyday 
I learned there was a new component to the assignment. I also had a lot of issues of just trying to figure out how to write a test and make the
test run. For the tests, I feel that there are a lot of tests to run and I keep getting errors while trying to run a test that outputs an array. 
I feel that I wasn't prepared to do this much work in tests when I've never done anything with programming tests before. 

For the next assignment, I plan to read through the entire README file beofre starting the assignment to get a better grasp of all the components 
of the assignment and plan accordingly to work on it, so there's not too much to do closer to the deadline.
